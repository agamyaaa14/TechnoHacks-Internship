# My TechnoHacks Data Science Internship Journey

Welcome to my TechnoHacks Data Science Internship repository! Here, I tackled exciting projects aimed at applying data science techniques to real-world challenges. Below are the tasks I focused on during this internship:

## Tasks

1. **Task-1 Fraud Transaction Detection**
   - Delved into machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.
   - Evaluated model using key performance metrics such as accuracy and precision.

2. **Task-2 Email Spam Filtering**
   - Developed a spam detection system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
   - Through preprocessing text data, feature extraction, and model training, aimed to accurately classify emails as spam or non-spam.

3. **Task-3 Churn Prediction**
   - Built a predictive model to forecast customer churn using customer behavior and demographic data.
   - By applying classification algorithms, identified customers at risk of churning and proposed effective retention strategies.
